			<strong>Product Descriptions : </strong>
			ValueBasket.com makes every effort to make our product descriptions as accurate as possible. However, ValueBasket.com does not warrant that the product descriptions or other content found on the website is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Pricing : </strong>
			ValueBasket.com cannot confirm the price of an item until you place your order. Whilst ValueBasket.com makes every effort to make our pricing as accurate as possible, some items found listed on our website may be mispriced; if the correct price for an item is actually higher than your ordered price, ValueBasket.com will, at our own discretion, either contact you for further details before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Order Placement And Import : </strong>
			By placing an order with ValueBasket.com, you accept all responsibility for ensuring that your purchase can be imported in accordance with the laws of the country to which you have requested ValueBasket.com to ship your purchase and you also agree that you are the sole importer for the purchase of your product for all purposes, including but not limited to customs regulations, copyright and trademark laws and you agree to comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which the goods are received. To this end, you acknowledge and agree that ValueBasket.com's role is limited to procuring your purchased products in Hong Kong and other regions, and making these products available through the website to you for purchase in Hong Kong and for your import to your country. Under no circumstances will ValueBasket.com be party to the import of such products nor will ValueBasket.com be responsible for any liability arising under the laws of any country other than Hong Kong for the import and sale of products available on the site, including without limitation customs regulations and customs holds, detentions and seizures and copyright and trademark laws. Customers outside Hong Kong authorize ValueBasket.com to make arrangements for customs clearance on their behalf for the purchases made. Customs clearance procedures may mandate the opening and inspection of cross-border deliveries.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Import, Taxes And Fees : </strong>
			Where import duties and taxes (directly and indirectly related) are applicable on overseas deliveries outside Hong Kong, these will normally be subjected to the recipient; directly related taxes and duties include those import taxes/duties that are levied on the invoiced order, any courier's customs handling surcharges and any Free Domicile forwarding surcharges levied by the courier; indirectly related taxes and duties arise from different customs policies around the world which may apply other additional customs or clearance costs. Customs policies differ in each country, hence you should contact your local customs office for further queries relating to the applicable policies. ValueBasket.com has no control over these import duties or taxes. For some item and delivery destination country combinations, an import handling fee borne by ValueBasket.com may be included and noted on your shipment invoice. Where an import handling fee is included, ValueBasket.com will bear liability for the taxes and duties that are only directly related to the invoiced order. Any Import handling fee included on your shipment notice is non-refundable. No terms and conditions contained in the confirmation of your payment or of your purchase order or other document of the buyer will form part of the contract.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Payment For Purchases : </strong>
			Payment for the ordered items is due at the time the order is acknowledged. ValueBasket.com may offer, at the point of checkout, various payment methods in addition to the bank transfer method for customers to make payment for their ordered items; bank transfer payments may be made to Fairmode Inc., Pasay City (details of which are to be confirmed, and shall be provided during the checkout process). You will accept responsibility to pay all costs and fees in connection with your ordered items in relation to the use of the payment method of your choice. In the event of any unauthorized transactions made to your payment account by a third party, you will be responsible for the amounts billed. Where payment for purchase(s) on our website is not settled to ValueBasket.com, you will agree to pay all amounts due to ValueBasket.com upon demand.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Order Acceptance : </strong>
			Placing an order with, or making a payment to, ValueBasket.com represents your offer to us to make a purchase of the ordered items. ValueBasket.com will email you acknowledgement of your offer to confirm your order details. The offer of your purchase will be accepted by ValueBasket.com when we dispatch the product to you and e-mail you confirmation of this, as represented by a dispatch email. In the event your order includes multiple items, any item(s) included in your offer of purchase that are not dispatched and not included in the dispatch email, will not be included in the acceptance of your offer of purchase for those affected items.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Pre-Orders : </strong>
			Where your order basket includes "in stock" items along with "pre-order" items, "in stock" items are to be shipped at earliest when the items on "pre-order" are available for dispatch.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Passage of Risk : </strong>
			All items purchased from, and have payment settled to, ValueBasket.com are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon delivery to the carrier selected by ValueBasket.com to deliver your order.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Split-Orders : </strong>
			ValueBasket reserves the right to split your order proactively where multiple items are purchased on a single order to provide a faster delivery. ValueBasket.com will email you acknowledgement of your split order to confirm your dispatch order details. The changes will also be reflected on your My Account page with the remainder of your items to be shipped at earliest opportunity.<br /><br />
			<strong>Cancellation, Returns and Refunds : </strong>
			You can submit cancellation requests by e-mail for your order at any time prior to making payment. No cancellations, returns or refunds for any reason whatsoever shall be accepted nor permitted once payment has been received for your order.
			<br /><br />
			Where a refund is requested and eligibility confirmed in accordance with these Conditions of Use, we will process the refund for the corresponding amount as soon as practicable; in any event the refund may take up to 30 (thirty) days, after refund eligibility is confirmed, to appear in your payment account.
			<br /><br />

			No product warranties whatsoever are provided for any products included in your order.

Arbitration will not include any judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration ward is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would. Arbitration shall be conducted, and documents presented, in English; or be accompanied by an English translation of the documents. The Arbitration award will state the reason(s) upon which the award is based.
