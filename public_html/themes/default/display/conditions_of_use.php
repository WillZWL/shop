                        <br /><br />
                        While we make every effort to provide accurate information, technical inaccuracies or typographic or photographic errors may occur. We reserve the right to make changes, corrections, and/or improvements to the information contained on this Site at any time without notice.
                        <br /><br />

Possible circumstances involving cancellation of orders may be limitations on quantities available for purchases or inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information.

                        When you place an order to purchase a product from DigitalDiscount.co.uk, we will send you an e-mail confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order. Your order represents an offer to us to purchase a product which is accepted by us when we send e-mail confirmation to you that we've dispatched that product to you (the \"Dispatch Confirmation E-mail\"). That acceptance will be complete at the time we send the Dispatch Confirmation E-mail to you. Any products on the same order which we have not confirmed in a Dispatch Confirmation E-mail to have been dispatched do not form part of that contract.") ?>

                    <h3 id="tax_duties">TAX AND DUTIES</h3>
                    <p>
                        In using our services, you authorize ChatandVision to make arrangements for customs clearance for the products ordered. The responsibility for ensuring that your ordered product can be lawfully imported outside of Hong Kong to your destination country remains with our customers, and any applicable import duties and taxes will be subjected to the recipient. We do not have control over these import duties and taxes. Customs policies vary widely from country to country, hence if you should have any queries regarding your local Customs policies, contact your local Customs office for further information.
                        <br /><br />
                        Where the price of the goods allows, certain shipments to some countries may include a fee which is borne by ChatandVision, for import of the goods. This will be noted on your shipment invoice.
                        <br /><br />
                        In the event where customs clearance is required, this will cause delays to the original delivery estimate.

                    <h3 id="delivery">DELIVERY</h3>
                    <p>

                        <i>Your order should not take any more than 7 to 14 working days to arrive, however, this is not guaranteed and we cannot be held responsible for events outside of our control.

                    <p>
                        The period in which you can exercise the right to cancel an order is 30 days beginning the day after your goods are received. The cancellation request has to be received by us in writing - by email, or letter. The unused goods (including any accessories which were included in the price of the goods) must be returned at the customer's expense within 30 days after receipt of parcel and customer is responsible for any damage during the transit of the returned goods, (it also applies to products purchased as Christmas presents).

                        In the unlikely event your order is damaged in transit please contact us immediately. Please send the product back to us in the original packaging and a valid RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) form. We will arrange for a prompt replacement or refund, whichever is your preference.

If no response is received from you within 7 days from the date of emailing, ChatandVision will follow up with a kind reminder in the form of a 1st and 2nd email at 7 day intervals. In the event no response is received within 7 days of the 2nd email being sent, ChatandVision will send a 3rd and final reminder email together with a recorded letter.
