                    <p>
                        We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
						<br /><br />
						ChatandVision takes your privacy very seriously. ChatandVision does not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers.
						<br /><br />
						ChatandVision may share certain personal information with other companies with which ChatandVision have a strategic relationship and/or provide services on our behalf to your advantage. These companies may help process information, fulfil customer orders, deliver products, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess levels of interest in our product range, or carry out customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obliged to protect your personal information, except if exchange of information is required for your purchase. For example, when an extended warranty is purchased, you authorise ChatandVision and the Warranty Provider to exchange information to carry out the service. Without the exchange, it would be otherwise be difficult to have products purchased, customer service offered, feedback provided to us, or have access to special offers or content from ChatandVision.
						<br /><br />
						We may also be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information if it is determined that it is necessary for security, law enforcement or other issues of public importance.
